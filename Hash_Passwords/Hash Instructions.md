Accept users registration
Provide options for computer-generated passwords (Task 1)
Proactively check users’ own passwords (Task 2)
Lower case + Upper case + numbers + symbols + at least 8 characters
Use the hashed password function when loading new passwords (Task 3)
Save the hashed password to a password file (Task 4)
Verify users’ authentication for log-in attempts (Task 5)
Use the hashed password function to verify

Task 1
Generate a string, whose length is in [8, 20], containing at least one upper case, one lower case, one number and one symbol.
Consider Python’s string and random module.
Print the string
You need 1 or 2 player(s)

Task 2
Read inputs from keyboard typing
Consider Python’s input() method/function
Check a string’s length and whether contains upper case, lower case, number and symbol
Consider Python’s len() method
You check Regular Expressions (regex), consider Python’s re module
You need 2 or 3 players

Task 3
Write a string into a file
You need 0.5 player

Task 4
Generate the salt (random number)
Consider Python’s random.uniform() method
Implement a one-way hash function
Consider Python’s hashlib module
You need 2 or 3 players

Task 5
Read a string (password) from the keyboard input
Call your hash function to verify the password
You need 0.5 player
